This directory contains control software to generate an quadratic (FRB) sweep of frequencies using an RPi4 and PTS frequency synthesizer. wavegen.py contains the source code for WaveGen, which initializes the GPIO pins of the RPi and converts the input frequency from decimal to binary form for transmission to the PTS. The accepted PTS models are the PTS 3200, 500, and 300. This code can be used to generate a continuous wave, linear sweep, or a quadratic sweep.
