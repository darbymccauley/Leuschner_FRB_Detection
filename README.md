# Leuschner Radio Observatory FRB Detector
This project, done under the supervision of both Professors Wenbin Lu and Aaron Parsons of the University of California, Berkeley, seeks to make use of the Leuschner Student Observatory's 3.5m radio telescope to detect and study fast radio bursts (FRBs). The main source of observation is magnetar SGR1935+2154, which is most visible to us in the sky for extended periods of time. This project aims to capture a kJy ms sensitive FRB.
