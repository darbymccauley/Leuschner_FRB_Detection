# LIMBO: Long Integration Mangetar Burst Observatory
This project, done under the supervision of both Professors Wenbin Lu and Aaron Parsons of the University of California, Berkeley, seeks to make use of the Leuschner Student Observatory's 3.5m radio telescope to detect and study fast radio bursts (FRBs). The main source of observation is magnetar SGR1935+2154, which is most visible to us in the sky for extended periods of time. This repository holds all developmental work.

The repository can be split into two main parts:
_ 1.) FDMT: Contains the source code for the [FDMT dedispersion algorithm](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/link_gateway/2017ApJ...835...11Z/arxiv:1411.5373) used during FRB observation.
_ 2.) Sims: Constains code for computer generated FRB simulations as well as wavegen, a package used to simulate FRBs in a lab using a Raspberry Pi and a PTS frequency synthesizer.
